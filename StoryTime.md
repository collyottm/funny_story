It was a dark and stormy night 
two dead boys went out to fight
back to back they fought eachother
the adventurers come across a dangerous looking dungeon. 
One fine day in the middle of the night 
two dead boys went out to fight 
back to back they shot eachother
drew their swords and shot eachother
the deaf police man heard the noise
came to stop the two dead boys
if you do not believe this story is true
just ask the blind man he saw it too
